How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
more efficient correction of errors, spend less time backing up versions of a file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pro: better control of version points      con: manual means could forget to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
google docs is designed for file editing, git is designed for programming

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the versions that were saved, git diff gives the line that have changed between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
much more confident because it would be easier to track down when and where the break occured

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
programming projects
